A machine learning project to predict Olympic medal counts for countries based on historical data.

## 🏆 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict how many medals a country will win in the Olympics using:
- Number of athletes sent
- Medal count from previous Olympics

**Key Steps:**
1. Formulated hypothesis
2. Explored and cleaned Olympic dataset
3. Built linear regression model
4. Evaluated performance using Mean Absolute Error

## 📊 Dataset

We use historical Olympic data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) containing:
- `teams.csv`: Country-level aggregated data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools:**
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
